# Tab Out

**Keep tabs on your tabs.**

Tab Out is a Chrome extension that replaces your new tab page with a dashboard of everything you have open. Tabs are grouped by domain, with homepages (Gmail, X, LinkedIn, etc.) pulled into their own group. Close tabs with a satisfying swoosh + confetti.

No server. No account. No external API calls. Just a Chrome extension.

## Install with a coding agent

Send your coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) this repo and say **"install this"**:

```
https://github.com/zarazhangrui/tab-out
```

The agent will walk you through it. Takes about 1 minute.

## How it works

```
You open a new tab
  -> Tab Out shows your open tabs grouped by domain or browser window
  -> In Windows view, drag a tab to another window or a new position
  -> Homepages (Gmail, X, etc.) get their own group at the top
  -> Click any tab title to jump to it
  -> Close groups you're done with (swoosh + confetti)
  -> Archive tabs you want out of memory but not out of mind
  -> Restore archived tabs into the current window with one click
```

Everything runs inside the Chrome extension. No external server, no API calls, no data sent anywhere. Archived tabs are stored in `chrome.storage.local`.
